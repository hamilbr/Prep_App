<h1>Whirl the World - Flexible 
 Working</h1>
<p class="ShadedEmphasis">The policy and procedures relating to Flexible 
 Working do not form part of your terms and conditions of employment.</p>
<p>The company’s Flexible Working Policy outlines the company’s commitment 
 to consider flexible working arrangements for employees to meet their 
 childcare or adult care needs.</p>
<p>The company recognizes the contribution of all its employees and also 
 understands that at some time in their working lives, employees may find 
 it difficult to fulfil domestic, family and working commitments due to 
 having a young family, adopting, having a disabled child or caring for 
 an adult. Where this occurs, the company will always consider practical 
 help through this flexible working policy.</p>
<p>No employee will be treated less favorably, suffer detriment or be dismissed 
 because they request, or take, flexible working.</p>
<p>Flexible working is about considering the way work is organized to see 
 whether it is possible to have different arrangements. The result must 
 always be, however, that the company achieves its core business purpose 
 as efficiently as is possible.</p>
<p>Employees should also be aware that if they request and are given agreed 
 flexible working conditions this is a variation of their terms and conditions 
 of employment and is a permanent change. If their circumstances change 
 in relation to the need for flexible working there is no statutory right 
 for a return to their terms and conditions as they were prior to the flexible 
 working.</p>
<p>The company:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>
 <p>Will consider requests for flexible working by those who are 
	 eligible to put in a written request</p></li>
	<li>
 <p>Recognizes that the initial onus of making an application is 
	 with the employee</p></li>
	<li>
 <p>Will follow the correct procedure as outlined here</p></li>
	<li>
 <p>Will reject an application where it is considered that on the 
	 grounds of business it cannot allow the flexible working as it will 
	 be detrimental to the company achieving its business</p></li>
	<li>
 <p>Will meet with the employee within 28 days of the application 
	 to discuss the application and will write to the employee outlining 
	 its decision within 14 days.</p></li>
</ul>

  <p>Consideration of the request</p></td>
		<td>
  <p>The organization will give serious and full consideration 
		 to all requests to work flexibly from eligible parents.</p>
		<p>If a request cannot be agreed without further discussion, a 
		 meeting will be arranged within 28 days to discuss this and consider 
		 alternative flexible options.</p>
		<p>The employee is entitled to be represented at that meeting by 
		 a work colleague. If the employee or his or her representative 
		 is not available for the meeting then an alternative time suitable 
		 for all parties should be agreed upon and held within seven days.</p>
		<p>If the organization cannot meet the employee’s request it will 
		 be on one or more of the following grounds:</p>
		<ul style="list-style: disc;">
			<li>
   <p>The burden of additional costs.</p></li>
			<li>
   <p>The detrimental impact on meeting customer/service demands.</p></li>
			<li>
   <p>An inability to re-organise or re-distribute work among 
			 other existing staff.</p></li>
			<li>
   <p>An inability to recruit additional staff (this may particularly 
			 be the case where the request leaves unusual hours to be filled 
			 by another employee).</p></li>
			<li>
   <p>A detrimental impact on quality or performance.</p></li>
			<li>
   <p>There is insufficient work available during the hours 
			 the employee is requesting to work.</p></li>
			<li>
   <p>Other structural changes are planned.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Whatever the outcome of the meeting, the result will be confirmed 
		 to the employee in writing within 14 days of the meeting, unless 
		 an extension is agreed.</p>
		<p>If the requested change of working arrangements is accepted, 
		 the new terms and conditions that apply are permanent. The employee 
		 has no right to return to his or her old terms and the employer 
		 has no right to enforce a return unless a trial of the new terms 
		 has not proved successful.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="t1Row">
		<td>
  <p>Trial Period</p></td>
		<td>
  <p>The organization may decide to offer the new way of working 
		 on a trial basis initially if it is not sure what the impact of 
		 it will be on the business. In such circumstances, the change 
		 to the employee’s terms and conditions of employment during the 
		 trial period is a temporary change to his or her terms and conditions 
		 of employment.</p>
		<p>If the trial is not successful, the employee will revert back 
		 to his or her previous terms and conditions of employment. If 
		 the requested change of working arrangements is accepted at the 
		 end of the trial then the temporary terms and conditions will 
		 become permanent.</p></td>

	<tr class="t2Row">
		<td>
  <p>Appeal</p></td>

  <p>The employee has the right of appeal if his or her application 
		 to work flexibly is declined and must put his or her appeal in 
		 writing within 14 days of receipt of the employer’s decision, 
		 unless an extension is agreed.</p>
		<p>The letter of appeal must clearly state the grounds for appeal 
		 and a further meeting will then be arranged in the same manner 
		 as the original hearing giving the employee the right to be accompanied.</p>
		<p>Following the appeal hearing, the employer will confirm the 
		 outcome in writing within a further 14 days (unless an extension 
		 has been agreed) detailing any agreement that has been met or 
		 an explanation of the grounds for dismissing the appeal.</p>
		<p>The decision at the appeal hearing stage is final.</p>
		<p>Where an employee appeals, another person may accompany him 
		 or her. This may be another employee of the company. An appeal 
		 may be requested and must be submitted in writing setting out 
		 the grounds, within 14 days of the decision.</p></td>

  <p>Extension of time limits</p></td>

  <p>There is an allowance for the extension of time limits within 
		 the procedure where the manager and the employee agree. This may 
		 occur in the following two circumstances:</p>
		<ul style="list-style: disc;">
			<li>
   <p>Further exploration of work patterns – at the request 
			 meeting it may be agreed by the manager and the employee that 
			 there needs to be further research into the possibilities 
			 – a record should be made of this agreement in writing, by 
			 the manager, with the extension of the time limit noted.</p></li>
			<li>
   <p>Absence of the manager – this may apply where he or 
			 she is taking annual leave or sick leave. In either case, 
			 the time limit will be extended where the manager is absent. 
			 In this case, the manager will have 28 days to arrange the 
			 meeting from the day of his or her return to work.</p></li>

		 an automatic extension.</p></td>

  <p>When an application may be treated as withdrawn</p></td>

  <p>The company will consider an application as being withdrawn 
		 and will no longer have a duty to consider the request when:</p>
		<ul style="list-style: disc;">
			<li>
   <p>An employee gives written notification to the manager 
			 that he or she is withdrawing their application. Where the 
			 written information is not forthcoming, the manager will write 
			 seeking clarification that the employee has withdrawn their 
			 application.</p></li>
			<li>
   <p>An employee fails to meet their responsibilities under 
			 the procedure and, therefore, it is fair in the circumstances 
			 for the manager to assume that the application is no longer 
			 being pursued. The two areas where this may occur are:</p></li>
			<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
   <ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li>
    <p>Failure to attend the application meeting or the 
				 appeal meeting, more than once</p></li>
				<li>
    <p>Unreasonably refusing to provide the manager with 
				 information that he or she needs in order to assess whether 
				 the contract variation can be granted.</p></li>

		 eligible to make another flexible working request for a further 
		 twelve months</p></td>
