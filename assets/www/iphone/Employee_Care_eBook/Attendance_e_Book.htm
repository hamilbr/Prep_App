<h1>Whirl the World - Attendance</h1>
<p>The company wishes to support staff who are unable to fulfil the terms 
 of their employment contract regarding attendance at work for reasons 
 beyond their control. However, the Company expects this support to be 
 reciprocated by all employees so that they comply with their conditions 
 of employment.</p>
<p>This policy is intended to alert and assist managers to reduce the incidence 
 of absence. It is essential that managers have specific responsibility 
 for attendance of their staff and that their staff understand that the 
 policy will be enforced.</p>
<p>Requests for all types of absence must be made to and approved by the 
 employee's manager.</p>
<h2>Types of absence</h2>
<p>Absence from work occurs for a variety of reasons, but the most common 
 are:</p>
<h3>Company Policy</h3>
<p>Holidays</p>
<p>Study Leave</p>
<p>Maternity Leave</p>
<h3>Absence by employee</h3>
<p>Sickness</p>
<p>Accident</p>
<p>Medical Consultation</p>
<h3>Statutory</h3>
<p>Jury Service</p>
<h3>Unauthorized Absence</h3>
<p>Lateness of over two hours</p>
<p>Non-conformance with the Policy</p>
<p class="Normal-Single">&#160;</p>
<p>The scale of entitlements is sufficient to allow for most discretionary 
 requirements. &#160;However, a manager has discretion to allow up to two 
 days paid or unpaid additional leave per year appropriate for the circumstances.</p>
<h2>Procedure for Unauthorized Absence</h2>
<p class="ShadedEmphasis">This procedure is concerned with unauthorized 
 absences that have NOT been approved by an employee’s manager.</p>
<p>To be eligible for sick pay, an employee must comply with the procedures 
 for the notification and certification of absence set out below.</p>
<h3>Unavailable to work</h3>
<p>If an employee is unavailable for work, he/she must inform his/her manager, 
 and give an estimated date of return to work.</p>
<p>The manager must be informed as soon as possible, and in any event not 
 later than the commencement of <a href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" id="HotSpot32896">Core time</a><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript1.2">//<![CDATA[
TextPopupInit('HotSpot32896', 'POPUP32896');
//]]></script><span class="glosstext" id="POPUP32896" style="display: none;"> [The hours between which office based employees must be in the office.]</span> 
 [10.00 am] on the day of absence.</p>
<h3>Unable to telephone</h3>
<p>If the employee is unable to telephone to advise they will be absent, 
 a member of the household should make the call.</p>
<p>Information must not be left with the Call Centre operator or another 
 employee - if the employee’s manager is not available, the Human Resources 
 Administrator must be notified and they will ensure the employee's manager 
 is advised.</p>
<h3>Recording absence</h3>
<p>All absence, irrespective of the reason, must be recorded on the employee’s 
 time-sheet so that the reason[s] and duration of absence[s] are accurately 
 reflected.</p>
<h3>Failure to report absence</h3>
<p>If an employee fails to report to his/her manager, or cannot be located 
 within three working days, the Company reserves the right to withhold 
 pay for the period of the absence and to take any other relevant action.</p>
<h3>Return to work</h3>
<p>On return to work, managers must interview the employee to confirm the 
 reason for the absence.&#160;If the employee has a recurring medical problem, 
 and there is no medical advice to support frequent self-certified absences, 
 the Company may require his/her consent to an examination by a Company 
 nominated doctor. </p>
<h2>Procedure for dealing with poor attendance</h2>
<p>The company has control procedures to monitor unacceptable levels of 
 absence because of their adverse impact on the Company's business objectives. 
 In determining what constitutes an excessive level of absence and therefore 
 whether to commence disciplinary action, the following will be taken into 
 account:</p>
<p>- The reasons for any absence</p>
<p>- The severity of the problem</p>
<p>- The number of absence events</p>
<p>- Any apparent pattern</p>
<p>- The impact on the department and/or employee’s workload</p>
<p>- Other circumstances.</p>
<p class="ShadedEmphasis">Managers must identify employees with poor attendance 
 records and discuss these with them. Human Resources must be advised of 
 this action. &#160;The employee must be informed of the facts and records 
 of unauthorized absence and warned that if there is no improvement in 
 attendance, the Company’s Disciplinary Procedures may be initiated.</p>
